## Features implemented in this game

This game has a Kiki's Delivery Theme twist to the combination of Angry Birds and Flappy Birds! Help Kiki pass through pipes, avoid bread, collect cacti for extra points and windy coulds to take a break. 

* **Player Character:** Using a button, control Kikiâ€™s flight. There is an animation of her moving in her flight. 
* **Pipe:**  Appear in pairs every in semi-random intervals. One life is taken from Kiki when a collision with any pipe occurs. Kiki bounces backward and drops immediately upon collision. 
* **Bonus Objects:** Appear randomly on the upward facing pipes and could be collected either by the bread or Kiki. If a bread collects a bonus object, points are lost. If the bird collects a bonus object, two different things could happen. If a cactus is collected, 1 extra point is added. If a windy cloud is collected, 6 seconds of autopilot mode will be triggered.
* **Bread:** drop randomly from downward facing pipes and capable of collecting bonus objects on the pipe below it. If the bread collections the bonus object before Kiki, 3 points are lost. The game is over and score is reset to 0 if Kiki collides with the bread. Kiki bounces backward and drops immediately upon collision.
* **Scene:** the background changes every 10 seconds between the places Kiki flys along her delivery routes.
* **Floor:** moves along with the pipes and bonus objects. 
* **Interactive User Panel:** has information about the bread and bonus objects, and has the button which starts the game and makes Kiki fly. 
* **Score and Lives:** points earned are kept track of, and there are 3 lives, which can be lost when Kiki runs into a pipe, bread, or the floor.
